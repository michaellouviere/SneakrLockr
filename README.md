# SneakrLockr&reg; - Inventory management for the sneaker head
StockX Code Challenge

## What does this app do?

1. Using React.js and Redux, this app automatically dispatches 25 inventory items to the store with some default data for the first 5
..* Brand
..* Style
..* Size
..* UPC Code
2. Inventory List/Item Components grab items from store and display them in a 5x5 Grid
3. When an item in the store already has a UPC Code, we allow editing and/or removing of the item, otherwise we allow for editing

## To Run this app, execute the following commands in a terminal window:
1. npm install (Installs app dependencies)
2. npm run dev-server
